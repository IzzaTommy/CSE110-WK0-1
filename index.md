 As a person, I constantly live by my mother's quote:

## About Me as a Programmer
As a programmer, I like designing programs that allow you to create infographics about topics within those [games](#about-me-as-a-gamer). My favorite programming language is Java, but I also like Python because the syntax is very simple.

Printing in Python is just `print()`.

Whereas in Java it is `System.out.print()`.

[Here is one thing about Java that I like](README.md).

One of the reasons I am taking **CSE 110** is to fulfill my [degree requirements](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/curric/CSE-ug.html). Currently, my progess is as follows:
- [x] Lower division CSE classes
